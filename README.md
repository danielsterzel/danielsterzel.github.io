### Daniel Sterzel personal website
The project is **still** underway however it is working quite well so far. Here are some features in the webiste:
 - Menu taking you to specific sections of the website.
 - Interactive "About me" section containing my qualifications and my abilities.
 - Interactive images leading to my other projects.
 - A contact me section.
 - Download CV button.
 - Link to my Facebook and Discord profile.
So far that's all I have in store for the website. New things will be added, some things will be changed, this is not the final version yet.
### Usage
Very simple just click, in the menu, where do you want to go in the website and it will take you there.
